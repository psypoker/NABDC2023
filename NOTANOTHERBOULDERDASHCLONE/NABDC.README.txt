hi dear oric fans

here is a recreation of the boulder dash game for the oric atmos 48k

NOT ANOTHER BOULDER DASH CLONE !

story :
	the project was started on december 2015 as a demo, initially to test some 
	asm routines. But it was stopped because it was the end of the holiday.
	The from may to june, I took some time to resume this project
	converting algorithms from js to C in osdk then rewriting most of the c routines  
	to asm ones to gain asignificant speed-up. Unfortunately the game is a little hard now :)
	The graphics were converted from 16x16 sprites to 18x16 sprites
	with paint.net and some private c# tools 
	
	Inspired from codeincomplete.com
	Made with the great osdk 0.18
	Intro music from midi file of original tune
	Original game by Peter Lepia and Chris Gray
	Licensed from FirstStarSoftware inc.

	The sound is still not complete and a bit experimental
	but the game is fully tested and playable 

features:
	20 playable levels
	4 color graphics in textmode and altmode (paper,ink,inverse paper,inverse ink)
	hall of fame
